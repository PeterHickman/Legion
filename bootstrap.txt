# This file bootstraps a box installing the basics to
# run and secure the system. Some of the principals are
# general but the specifics are mine
#
# An additional caution is that the firewall code is from
# another project of mine (https://github.com/PeterHickman/Firewall)
# that was developed because ufw didn't work how I needed
# it to. So in the vein of perpetual wheel reinvention I
# went ahead and wrote my own

# This first step means that all the software that we require
# to complete this script is available and up to date before we
# get down to the hard work
